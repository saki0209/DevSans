        <h2>Our Objectives</h2>
        <p>Punjab is lagging behind in education. We have therefore started to strengthen education at the grassroots to build up its students to such a caliber where everyone may feel proud of. All-around development of the students will help them to seek admission in career-oriented courses. At the same time, a directory of passed-out students will be prepared to keep in touch with these students. By producing trustworthy students committed to the cause of service to society, the message of "Creating Honesty Within" will be given all around.</p>
